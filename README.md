# pytorch-intel-image-classification
This project uses PyTorch and torchvision to classify images from the Intel Image Classification dataset. A pre-trained Wide ResNet-50-2 model is fine-tuned for the task. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, with results visualized for performance assessment.
